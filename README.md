## Title: Predicting Failure of Johannesburg Stock Exchange Companies Using Machine Learning

#### Description
The dynamic nature of the contemporary business environment has made corporate failures commonplace, and so raised the alarm for corporation to start considering their going concern seriously. On the higher end, all sorts of businesses can benefit from knowing their likelihood of failure with a good degree of statistical certainty. In this project I adopt and compare 7 different techniques of predicting bankruptcy, namely:

  (i). Machine Learning - Ensemble
  
    1. Random Forest
    2. Gradient boosting
    3. Bagging
    
  (ii). Machine Learning - Base Learner
  
    4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    5. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

  (iii). Traditional Statistical Methods
  
    6. Logistic regression

  (iv). Other
  
    7. k-Nearest Neighbours

#### Data

Dataset:
   
In this project I used data on 512 and 173 Johannesburg Stock Exchange listed companies between 1997 and 2022 obtained from DataStream database.
